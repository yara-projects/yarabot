# LIVE PHRASE CACHE — hot-reload without a restart
# INTENT_DATA above is the SEED/bootstrap definition only. At request time,
# every intent's actual phrase list comes from the `intent_phrases` MySQL
# table (source='seed'/'learned'/'manual' - see setup_database.py for the
# one-time seed migration and dashboard.py's Learned Phrases page for how
# 'learned'/'manual' rows get added), via the cache below on a 60s TTL -
# so a dashboard approval reaches students without a git push/redeploy,
# which was the entire point: a teacher approving a phrase at 9am
# shouldn't mean students wait for the next deploy.
#
# Deliberately a plain module-level dict, not anything shared across
# processes (no Redis - not needed at this scale). dashboard.py and app.py
# are separate processes (and, in production, separate hosts: the
# dashboard runs locally against the shared Aiven DB, app.py runs on
# Render), so each has its OWN copy of this cache. The dashboard's
# "Refresh NLP Now" button clears its own copy (incidental - the dashboard
# itself doesn't score live questions) and also calls app.py's own
# /api/admin/refresh-nlp-cache endpoint to force the LIVE process to
# reload instantly too - see app.py's refresh_nlp_cache() route.

    imported here, app.py already imports FROM this module, so callers
    pass it in instead). Used only to label the diagnostic warnings below
    as same-role (informational, but worth a human's attention) or
    cross-role (roles never co-occur at runtime, so cannot misroute
    anything). Without it, warnings are reported with no role context.

    role_groups: optional list of sets, each the FULL real intent
    candidate list of one role that actually contains target_intent (e.g.
    passing [ROLE_PERSONAL_INTENTS['principal']] when target_intent is
    principal-only, or one set per role when it's shared, like 'notices')
    - this is what makes the check simulate ACTUAL routing instead of
    approximating it. Falls back to treating `same_role_intents |
    {target_intent}` as a single group when not given (a coarser
    approximation: real per-role separation is lost, but still a routing
    simulation rather than pure keyword-text matching). If neither is
    given, no routing simulation runs at all (matches this function's
    original behavior for any caller that never passes role context).

    THE ACTUAL SAFETY DECISION (see _simulate_group_verdict()): runs
    score_intent() - the same function score_intent() itself uses at
    request time - against every intent in each role_group, as if this
    phrase were already added to target_intent, using the SAME
    NLP_SCORE_FLOOR/NLP_MARGIN_THRESHOLD the live router trusts. A phrase
    is "needs_review" only if some group would actually misroute it (a
    different intent wins outright, or ties/wins narrowly against another
    OTHER intent with target_intent nowhere near the top). target_intent
    winning outright, or landing in a close top-2 WITH target_intent as
    one of the two options (a "did you mean X or Y" clarification - never
    a silent wrong answer), or scoring too weakly to match anything at
    all (falls through exactly as it does today) are all safe outcomes.

    An earlier version of this function blocked on ANY literal keyword-
    list overlap with another intent, regardless of whether score_intent()
    would ever actually let that overlap cause a real collision (it
    ignores personal-signal/phrase-match/class-code bypasses entirely) -
    an audit of 1,320 real candidate phrases found this rejected roughly
    77% of them as unverified false positives. That check still runs, but
    now as a non-blocking diagnostic warning folded into the reason text
    on genuine failures, and included in the returned reason even on a
    "safe" verdict when there's something a human reviewer would still
    want to glance at.

    check #3 (below) is UNCHANGED and still a hard blocker: it protects
    against a bare AMBIGUOUS_KEYWORDS word colliding with FUTURE almanac
    content, which lives entirely outside INTENT_DATA and can never be
    caught by a routing simulation against other intents - this is a
    genuinely different risk category from same-role misrouting, not
