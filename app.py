def _nlp_lane_decision(question, role):
    """
    Core routing decision behind use_nlp_lane() (plain bool) and
    get_routing_decision() (the full tuple) - one implementation so they
    can't drift apart.

    Returns (use_nlp: bool, try_classifier: bool, nlp_intent: str|None,
    nlp_score: int, clarification: str|None,
    tie_candidates: list[tuple[str, int]]|None) - see
    get_routing_decision()'s own docstring for what each means to
    /api/chat, tie_candidates especially.

    AMBIGUITY GUARD: a raw top score from rank_intents() isn't trusted on
    its own anymore. It must clear NLP_SCORE_FLOOR (too weak otherwise -
    treated as no match, same as a genuine zero) AND beat the runner-up by
    NLP_MARGIN_THRESHOLD (otherwise it's a coin-flip tie, not a confident
    winner - "who is my teacher?" ties identity/subject_teacher at 1 each,
    "how many teachers teach?" ties teacher_count_by_subject/total_teachers
    at 5 each; list order used to silently decide both). A margin failure
    hands the tied candidates to the classifier for one tie-break attempt
    (see tie_candidates above) rather than guessing OR immediately asking
    the user - checked BEFORE the phrase-match/pronoun/almanac logic below,
    since even a phrase-backed score-3+ match must still clear this first.

    Asks NLP directly whether it recognizes the question as one of its own
    intents for this role, rather than gating on PERSONAL_SIGNALS pronouns
    first - that missed pronoun-free personal questions like "mondays
    periods". The general-knowledge check is skipped for personal-pronoun'd
    wording, so "what's my exam schedule" isn't misclassified as general
    knowledge just because it contains the phrase "exam schedule".

    Two-part fix for a recurring collision ("exam schedule" vs. timetable,
    "teachers day" vs. subject_teacher - an ambiguous word shared between a
    personal intent's keywords and real almanac content): nlp_helpers.py's
    score_intent() won't award a point for a bare AMBIGUOUS_KEYWORDS match
    with no phrase and no personal signal. Here, even when NLP still finds
    a weak (keyword-only) match, a confident competing almanac match
    (stricter score and query coverage, >= the NLP score) wins the tie - checked
    against the almanac's actual current content, so a future addition
    ("Founders' Day") is automatically protected with no code change.

    CLASSIFIER TRIGGER: try_classifier is True only when NEITHER lane is
    confident - NLP's score is zero or weak AND the almanac has no strong
    competing match. Real gap fixed here: the original version only set
    try_classifier on a weak-but-NONZERO score, skipping genuine zeros by
    design - but testing showed the most common real failure mode is
    exactly a genuine zero. "whats todays timetable" scores a TRUE ZERO,
    not weak-nonzero: "timetable" is AMBIGUOUS_KEYWORDS-blocked with no
    phrase and no personal-pronoun wording, so score_intent() discards it
    entirely. This revision treats zero and weak the same way for
    eligibility, while still requiring the almanac to also not be
    confident - keeps the cost-conscious "only genuinely uncertain
    questions get an extra Groq call" design.

    Personal-pronoun'd wording with any real (even weak) NLP match is still
    trusted outright, unchanged (e.g. "how many days was I absent" -> weak
    attendance match, answered correctly today). A pronoun'd question that
    finds NOTHING now goes through the same "neither lane confident" check
    as pronoun-free ones, instead of a doomed detour through the NLP lane
    first that would just fail again and reach Gemini one step later anyway.

# CLARIFICATION MEMORY
# A handler that can't extract what it needs (no subject/class/teacher
# named) asks a clarifying question instead of answering. Without this,
# the student's next message - "umm math" - was routed as a brand new,
# unrelated question and got a wrong answer instead of completing the one
# they were actually answering.
#
# Generalized from an earlier 4-intent version: registers every handler
# that can ask a clarifying question (all 8 - grep app.py for
# `return "Which` to reconfirm the full set if a new one is ever added),
# and stores richer state (resolved_slots/original_message/expires_at, not
# just intent+role) so the resume path can do more than blindly retry the
# bare follow-up text - see _resume_clarification_reply()'s merge-fallback
# and _is_topic_switch() below.
#
# Still fundamentally single-turn by design: pending_clarification is
# popped from the session the moment the next message arrives, whether or
# not it resolves anything, so a stale clarification can never linger into
# a later, unrelated conversation. expires_at is a second, time-based
# backstop on top of that (a follow-up minutes late shouldn't resume
